            R4A was a research team focused on delivering enhanced functionality to/with cyber-physical systems. The team is manned by Faculty members and Researchers at the Electrical and Computer Engineering School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, who have been extensively working on efficient and intelligent solutions for robotics, devices and systems. The main novelty of the R4A approach is the design and implementation of a middleware architecture and the respective tools that allow for rapid prototyping of device-agnostic applications. The R4A architecture supports the collaboration of robots, devices and/or “things" (in the IoT concept), as well as with cloud services and components, this way fostering a wide range of applications. The R4A approach has already been used in real problems and has proven efficient towards creating solutions in a fast and reliable manner.
